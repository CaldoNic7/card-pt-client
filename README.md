# Card PT: a card game like no other!

## Description

  This application enables the user to set up a killer workout with nothing but their mobile device and their body. The simple design and intuitive functionality make setting up a custom workout with whatever equipment is available, or with no equipment at all, a smooth process, allowing the user to focus on their godly gains instead of figuring out a complex routine for the day. Users can use it as a supplemental workout with a quick quarter deck round or they can crush an entire group with a full deck round. 

  I wanted to create this app because I loved (and hated) card pt when I ran physical training for my team while in the Army, but I often forgot to bring a deck of cards or the cards would get torn up, this way it's right there on your phone nothing extra needed.
